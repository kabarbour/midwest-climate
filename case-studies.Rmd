## Mitigation vs Adaptation

**Mitigation** aims to *reduce the causes of climate change* by lowering greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon sinks. Examples of mitigation projects include transitioning to renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and reforesting degraded land.

**Adaptation** focuses on *managing the impacts of climate change* by increasing resilience to its effects and adjusting current living conditions to be better equipped for the climate in the future. This includes building flood defenses, developing drought-resistant crops, and improving urban infrastructure to handle extreme weather.
