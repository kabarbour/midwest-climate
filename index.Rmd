# Introduction

some text here about how midwesterners dont think climate change is an issue facing them

give context and set up the problem in terms of midwesterners

some chart / info from ANES

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
options(scipen=999) #prevent it from using scientific notation when knitting html

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(cowplot)
library(ggalt)
library(ggtext)
library(plotly)
library(DT)
library(broom)
library(tufte)
library(reshape2)
library(RColorBrewer)

```

```{r}

climate_data_all <- read_csv("climate-data.csv", 
    col_types = cols(loc_id = col_character()))
#View(climate_data)

cities <- c("Kansas City", "Omaha", "Minneapolis", "Louisville", 
            "Chicago", "Indianapolis", "Milwaukee", "Cincinnati", 
            "Columbus", "Detroit", "Cleveland")
hazards <- c("Tmax95pctl_days", "Tmax40_days", "Tmax35_days", 
             "Twb31_days", "heatwave_duration", "heatwave_count", "drought_days")

climate_data <- climate_data_all %>%
  filter(city %in% cities, hazard %in% hazards)

climate_data$scenario <- factor(
  climate_data$scenario,
  levels = c("1995 - 2014", "1.5C", "2.0C", "3.0C")
)

```

# News Stories

insert links to news stories / headlines about increasing heatwaves & severe weather

make some graphics & hyperlink those images / links to their sources

# 35ยบ Heating

what is the impact of 35ยบ on people

electricity / health / etc

clickable buttons / tabs for the different degrees of heating

map - highlight each midwestern city - size of bubble = days above current heatwaves

various models are different colors - opacity to show the likelihood of different

*should i handle threshold in this?*

# Tmax 95 percentile

localized to 95 percentile

similar version of map above

# Heatwave Count

*heatwaves are getting more frequent.*

```{r}

heatwave_count <- climate_data %>%
  filter(hazard == "heatwave_count",
         indicator == "expectedvalue")

average_increase <- heatwave_count %>%
  group_by(scenario) %>%
  summarize(avg_heatwave_count = mean(mean_estimate, na.rm = TRUE))

print(average_increase)

```

*midwest can expect 6.4 -\> 7.5 heatwaves depending on warming scenario*

may "only be" one heatwave but that has big toll

show specific cities increasing

```{r fig.height=15, fig.width=8}

ggplot(heatwave_count, aes(x = mean_estimate, y = model, color = scenario)) +
  geom_point(size = 5, alpha = 0.8) +  
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(3, 10)) + 
  facet_grid(city ~ ., switch = "y") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0),  
    axis.title.y = element_blank()  
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Heatwave Count by Model and Scenario",
    x = "Mean Heatwave Count",
    color = "Scenario"
  ) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "YlOrBr") 

```

# Heatwave Duration

not only will there be more heatwaves, but they will be longer

```{r fig.height=15, fig.width=8}

heatwave_duration <- climate_data %>%
  filter(hazard == "heatwave_duration",
         indicator == "expectedvalue")

ggplot(heatwave_duration, aes(x = mean_estimate, y = model, color = scenario)) +
  geom_point(size = 5, alpha = 0.8) +  
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 24)) + 
  facet_grid(city ~ ., switch = "y") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0),  
    axis.title.y = element_blank()  
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Heatwave Duration by Model and Scenario",
    x = "Mean Heatwave Duration",
    color = "Scenario"
  ) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "YlOrBr") 

```

# Tie back to news stories and human costs

what are the human costs of climate change going to be

how will people see this in their own lives

**extreme weather scenarios**

[what is the big call to action here ??]{.underline}

feeling very ... disillusioned with 'democracy' at the moment and dont want to tell people "oh just go vote" but i also dont want to tell people "okay no more plastic straws for you. you must bike everywhere"

*the vibe for this feels more like "hey dummy you need to realize that climate change is going to impact you. yes you!!" and less of "time to start composting"*
