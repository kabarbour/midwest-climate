## Research

-   Case study table?

    -   “What if you were able to sort the projects by their category (adaptation, mitigation) but also by topic (transportation, food systems, etc). if you really wanted to get fancy - maybe you even sort by things like city type (small, medium, large) or by budget (high to low) or project lead (government, non profit, etc) to highlight the diverse means for change“



-   Case Study section

    -   **mitigation** vs **adaptation**

    -   pick a few of the case studies to highlight - create charts for that city in particular

        -   what challenges are the facing/what are they most at risk for

        -   what actions are they taking

        -   how are their actions intended to help mitigate or adapt to their challenges

        -   what is the outcome/result (so far)?
